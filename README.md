# SmartAR
I was asked to design and implement SmartAR, a smart ADT, which
automatically adapts to the dynamic content that it operates on. In other
words, it accepts the size (total number of n car registrations identified by
their key, i.e., license plate) as a parameter and uses an appropriate (set of)
ADTs to perform the followed operations efficiently, add, remove,
getValues, nextKeys prevKeysâ€¦ A Hashmap was used for this project.
